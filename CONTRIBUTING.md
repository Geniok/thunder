## Reporting a Bug

To report abug please folow this [template](../../issues/new?template=bug_report.md)

## Requesting a Feature

First of all, look around the already open issues to see if the feature was already requested in some form. In that case it's better to comment on the existing feature instead.

To request a feature please folow this [template](../../issues/new?template=feature_request.md)

In any case, be sure to describe the feature in enough detail, to consider its implications on existing parts of the software if relevant and to describe how it would help you in particular. Also, please consider including a mockup if the issue includes UI changes.

## Submitting a Patch

* Ideally, start with something small to get familiar with the review process and work up from there.
* Make an effort to follow the overal coding style, which is roughly based on the [Qt Creator coding style](https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qtcreator-extending/coding-style.html).
* Be prepared for detailed feedback on your patch and to make several revisions.
* Each pull request will be built automatically for Windows, Linux and macOS. If the build fails anywhere, please check if it may be a problem with your patch.
